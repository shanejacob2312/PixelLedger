| Contrast 0.9 | 66.7% | GOOD | 60.0 |
| Contrast 1.1 | 100% | PERFECT | 60.0 |
| Contrast 1.3 | 100% | PERFECT | 80.0 |
| Contrast 1.5 | 0% | POOR | 50.0 |

**Perfect**: 4/6 (66.7%)
**Success Rate**: 100%

**Note**: Excellent robustness against contrast adjustments!

---

### 9. **Cropping** (4 attacks) - ‚ùå **0% SUCCESS**
All cropping attacks failed.

**Reason**: Cropping removes portions of the watermark embedded in spatial domain.

---

### 10. **Salt & Pepper Noise** (3 attacks) - ‚ùå **0% SUCCESS**
All salt & pepper noise attacks failed.

**Reason**: Random pixel replacement corrupts watermark severely.

---

### 11. **Sharpening** (1 attack) - ‚ùå **FAILED**

---

### 12. **Combined Attacks** (5 attacks) - ‚úÖ **60% SUCCESS**
| Attack | Quality | Result | Delta |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| JPEG Q70 + Noise œÉ=5 | 100% | PERFECT | 60.0 |
| Brightness 0.7 + JPEG Q60 | - | FAILED | - |
| Scale 0.8x + Blur 5x5 | 0% | POOR | 60.0 |
| Extreme (JPEG + Bright + Noise) | - | FAILED | - |
| Triple (Bright + Blur + JPEG) | 0% | POOR | 40.0 |

**Perfect**: 1/5 (20%)
**Success Rate**: 60%
